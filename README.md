# Master’s Thesis: Impact of External Interventions on Governance Outcomes
Aug 2024 - Dec 2024

- Analyzed the impact of external interventions on state legitimacy, ​​political stability and rule of law in 30 countries (15 Fragile and 15 Non-Fragile) from 2006 to 2022.
  
- Executed data mining and manipulation on a substantial dataset (approximately 7.5 GB) utilizing SQL, Excel, and Python.
   
- Created a summary statistics table to evaluate the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of the variables.
   
- Developed correlation matrix heatmaps to visualize the strength and direction of linear relationships between various pairs of variables. Created scatter plots for the variables to detect any positive, negative, or neutral correlations between them.
   
- Conducted fixed effects regression (PanelOLS) and produced estimation summaries that highlighted coefficient estimates, standard errors, and p-values for all three hypotheses. The estimation summaries illustrated the overall model fit and how the variables displayed significant positive or negative relationships with one another.
   
- The findings revealed the intricate aspects of external intervention in fragile nations, indicating that foreign engagement, including financial and military aid from non-fragile countries, can enhance governance outcomes (state legitimacy, rule of law) in fragile nations; however, its effectiveness is influenced by interactions with domestic factors (public services, state legitimacy).
